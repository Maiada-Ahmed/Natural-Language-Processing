Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Review

The rapid growth of the internet helped spread electronic commerce, resulting in a shift from the traditional Brick and Mortar business model to purchasing directly through the internet. Moreover recently, there has been even more demand for online shopping due to the spread of covid-19, all the restrictions imposed on people movement and limitations on markets footfall. Over time, online shopping has evolved and is available now in many types such as online marketplaces like Amazon and social media. This flexibility allowed consumers to be aware of the product characteristics and quality before purchasing. In addition, product reviews written by the consumers play a significant role in the decision making, buying experience and shopping satisfaction since reviews are available for most kinds of products, even those unique ones. Hence, consumers tend to make buying decisions mainly based on other consumers' reviews and are influenced a lot by the reviews and those who wrote these reviews since they represent an actual experience. For that reason, E-commerce retailers have acknowledged how critical product reviews are since they can help to boost sales and enhance the product by extracting insights about customers' needs and concerns (AlZuâ€™bi et al. 2019).

On the other hand, product reviews became a vital part of the online store's business model beyond branding and marketing since they can provide insights on the performance of other areas of the company from the customer's point of view. Accordingly, many ideas were introduced to ensure consumers are exposed to the most valuable reviews, either by allowing users to vote for any given review as helpful or unhelpful or by using a rating system on reviews. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been an academic discipline for many decades and made its way in the last 5-10 years to adoption beyond academia in different industries and various applications or use cases such as sentiment analysis that helps convert unstructured text data (i.e. customer interactions, social media comments or reviews) into meaningful insights (Jurafsky & Martin 2014).

Sentiment analysis is one of the most common types of text classification that automatically indicates people's emotions towards something, whether it is positive, negative or neutral. In this coursework the focus was on predicting the sentiment for Amazon product reviews using supervised learning techniques.
